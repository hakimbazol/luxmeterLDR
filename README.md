# luxmeterLDR
An Arduino-based for make your analog LDR become simple Luxmeter for any monitoring systems project.

This script is used for implement the power equation that we get from the callibration of analog LDR and luxmeter.

Due to do callibration, we need good-callibrated luxmeter at first time.

And any spreadsheet software will be helpful to make the correlation between analog LDR and luxmeter.
